We won't make you implement any tests for this challenge, 
but we still want to see how you think about testing your code. 

If you WERE to implement tests for your function, what cases would you test?

List each case below in plain english with it's expected result. 

For example...
Case: user a views user b's recording x for the first time
Expected Result: etc etc

Case: As Joe when I view recordingA for the first time
Result: recordingA's count goes to 1

Case: As Joe when I view recordingA for the 2nd time
Result: recordingA's count remains 1

Case: As Jake when I view recordingA for the 1st time
Result: recordingA's count becomes 2

Case: As Jake when I view recordingC for the 1st time
Result: the api returns an error saying recordingC doesn't exist

Case: As Harry when I view recordingA for the 1st time
Result: the api returns an error saying user Harry doesn't exist
